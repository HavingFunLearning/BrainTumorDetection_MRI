## Overview
This was a toy use case using C-NN for classification of brain masses;
- The architecture used is EfficientNet;
- The small dataset problem was overcomed using Transfer knowledge and augumentation;


## Code:
- Here, the code is [here](https://github.com/SimBoex/BrainTumorDetection_MRI/blob/b83e07beea37d08ff3e7bd0386ffa523ee051aa9/CNN_Model.ipynb)
