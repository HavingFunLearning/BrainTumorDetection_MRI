# BrainTumorDetection
## Description:
The dataset is taken from kaggle at the following link: [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection/code)

## Overview
This was a toy use case using C-NN for classification of brain masses;
- The architecture used is taken from tutorial videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/@MLDawn)

## Observations:
- Here, already at the 10 epoch, I get perfect metrics. Obviously, this is due to the really different and clearly separable pictures.
